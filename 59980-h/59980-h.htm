<p class='c009'>The disposal of sewage is one of
the most important problems that
confront the municipal and sanitary
engineer to-day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The study of this subject dates
back to 1844 when the Healths of
Towns Commission of London
made the report which first showed
the real course of the rapid increase
in the death rate of the larger cities.
In this country practically nothing
was done until 1872 when the
Massachusetts Legislature instructed
the State Board of Health to
investigate and report on the
subjects of sewerage, sewage disposal,
and the pollution of streams,
and to-day Massachusetts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>leads in the investigation of the
best methods of sewage disposal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Six different methods for the
treatment of sewage are now in use.
These methods are used separately
or in combination, the choice depending
upon local conditions and the
amount of purification required:—</p>

<p class='c006'>These methods are:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1—</dt>
    <dd>Dilution.
    </dd>
    <dt>2—</dt>
    <dd>Irrigation.
    </dd>
    <dt>3—</dt>
    <dd>Intermittent Downward Filtration.
    </dd>
    <dt>4—</dt>
    <dd>Chemical Precipitation.
    </dd>
    <dt>5—</dt>
    <dd>Septic Tank.
    </dd>
    <dt>6—</dt>
    <dd>Contact Bed.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c006'>The purpose of this thesis is to
investigate each method and make
a comparison along the following
lines:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1—</dt>
    <dd>Purification.
    </dd>
    <dt>2—</dt>
    <dd>Capacity.
    </dd>
    <dt>3—</dt>
    <dd>Applicability.
    </dd>
    <dt>4—</dt>
    <dd>Cost.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>
  <h2 id='Dilution' class='c008'><span class='under'>Dilution</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>Disposal of sewage by dilution
is the most common method at
the present time, and no doubt
will continue to be for some time
to come where the stream or body
of water is not used for domestic
purposes. Under certain conditions
this affords a satisfactory solution
of the problem. However, if the water
into which the sewage is discharged
is a source of water supply, two
very important questions arise. They
are: 1—How large must the dilution
be? 2—How far must the polluted
stream flow before the water way
may be used with safety to public
health?</p>

<p class='c006'>In 1867 Dr. Letheby and others
in England made the statement
that if sewage is diluted at least
twenty times its volume, it will
not only be made inoffensive but
be thoroughly destroyed after flowing
a dozen miles or more.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>The Rivers Pollution Commission
of Great Britain in 1878 maintained
that no river in England was long
enough to allow of a complete disappearance
of sewage matter discharged
into it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. F. P. Stearns in an article
on The Pollution and Self-Purification
of Streams in the Massachusetts
State Board of Health Report 1890
gives a table showing, “The calculated
composition of sewage for different
degrees of dilution in a running
stream”. A comparison was made
of the Blackstone and Merrimack
rivers, and extended over three years.
It was from this investigation that
the Commissioner of the City of Chicago
reported that the flow of the Chicago
Drainage Canal should be four
cubic feet per second per 1000 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c006'>The purification by dilution
may be due to three things:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1—</dt>
    <dd>Oxidation of organic matter.
<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span></div>
    </dd>
    <dt>2—</dt>
    <dd>Subsidence.
    </dd>
    <dt>3—</dt>
    <dd>Destruction of the organic matter by small animals and plants.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c006'>The oxidation is a very slow process
and depends mainly upon bacterial
life and conditions favorable to it.
Subsidence depends upon the difference
in the specific gravity of the suspended
matter, and the clarification is
increased as the velocity is diminished.</p>

<p class='c006'>In regard to the destruction
of the organic matter by small
animals and plants Dr. Sorby
says, (<cite>Journal Royal Microscopic
Society, 1884 p. 988</cite>.) “It appears to me
that the removal of impurities from
rivers is more of a biolytic than
a chemical question, and it is most
important to consider the action
of minute animals and plants,
which may be looked upon as
being indirectly most powerful
agents.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h2 id='Irrigation' class='c008'><span class='under'>Irrigation</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Although the method of broad
irrigation has been carried on successfully
in several of the largest cities
of the old world, it has not been
used to any great extent in the
United States, except at a few state
institutions in the east, and in
the arid districts of the west.</p>

<p class='c006'>Several years ago this method
of disposal was given much attention
as it was thought the sewage if used
would yield large profits, but
more recent information shows
conclusively that such is not
the case.</p>

<p class='c006'>Perhaps the most noticeable examples
of this system that are now
in operation in the United States
are the plants at the State Hospital
of the Insane, Worcester, Mass., at the
Rhode Island State Institute, and
at the Reformatory at Concord, Mass.
In all cases the labor was done by
the inmates so that it is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>possible to get a fair statement of
the cost. General information regarding
the use of sewage for
irrigation in the west may be
obtained from Baker and Rafters’
“Sewage Disposal in the United States”.</p>

<p class='c006'>Undoubtedly the best example
of sewage farming is at Berlin.
The following summary is given by
James H. Fuentes, M. Am. Soc. C. E., in
No. 2. Vol. 40 of the Engineering Record.
The average quantity of sewage pumped
to the farms and distributed amounts
to from 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 gallons
per acre per year, or in other words
each acre serves for 750 people.
The area farmed is divided into small
beds about 150 by 200 feet separated
from each other by slight embankments
and ditches for distributing the
sewage over the surface. The sewage
is admitted into the carriers from
the force mains through checking
chambers made of woven willow
and posts driven into the sand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The farms are said to yield small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>profits over the expenses of working
them, consequently contribute
scarcely anything toward the
cost of pumping the sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great reason why this
method of disposal has been
possible and profitable in a degree
at Berlin is that this large and
beautiful city lies in the midst
of an extensive sandy area, the
greater part of which in the immediate
neighborhood is quite sterile and
therefore comparatively thinly
populated. Better conditions for
such sewage farms could not exist.</p>

<p class='c006'>Statistics compiled by Chas. S.
Swan, M. Am. Soc. C. E. in his paper,
Notes on European Practice in
Sewage Disposal, in Jour. Assn.
of Eng. Soc. Vol. 7 No. 7 shows the
volume of sewage per acre per day
(yearly average) to vary from 2155
to 29450 gallons, and the average
depth per annum varies from
2.4 to 32.8 feet.</p>

<p class='c006'>The nineteenth annual report of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the Massachusetts State Board
of Health 1888 states that on an
ordinary farm in Massachusetts
2500 gallons per acre per day are as
much as could be applied to any
valuable grass crop. This would
require such a large area for large
cities that irrigation could not be
depended upon for preventing the
pollution of streams.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is evident from the above report
that the irrigation system can be
used to advantage only where large
tracts of low land can be obtained
at a low cost, and where help and
plenty of cheap labor can be obtained.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h2 id='Intermittent' class='c008'><span class='under'>Intermittent Downward Filtration</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Filtration means the concentration
of sewage on an area of especially
chosen porous ground, or on an especially
prepared bed as small as
will absorb and purify it. The
intermittency of application is a
necessary requirement even in suitably
constituted soils wherever complete
success is arrived at.  The reason
for this is that free oxygen is indispensable
to nitrification and the
nitrifying organism.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method has been in
operation only during the last thirty
years, and the correct theory of its
action has been found out within
the last ten years.</p>

<p class='c006'>Dr. Frankland, in the first report
of Rivers Pollution Commission of
England, shows that not only a
chemical action but also a biolytic
action takes place with the assistance
of minerals and the oxygen of the
air. This biolytic action is known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>as nitrification, and consists in
the oxidation of the nitrogen of
ammonia and its ultimate
conversion into nitric acid. This
change takes place in two stages,
each characterized by a distinct
organism. The office of one of
these organisms is to convert ammonia
into nitrite, while the
other converts nitrites into nitrate.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bacteria are present or
quickly develop in the sewage which
may be considered a nutrient
medium for them by reason of
containing a large amount of their
natural nitrogenous food.</p>

<p class='c006'>These organisms, according to
Warrington, may be separated by successive
cultivations in favorable
media; from a potassium nitrate
solution with no ammonia we may
obtain nitric organism alone; from
an ammonium carbonate solution
we may obtain nitrous organisms
in a pure state.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a noticeable fact that frost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>checks nitrification, but several
satisfactory methods have been
used so that no serious objection
can be raised to intermittent filtration
on this ground.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The purification of sewage by
this method depends upon the
oxygen and the time of action”
(Hazen). To obtain the highest efficiency
the sewage must be applied intermittently
and there must be a
large percentage of voids in the
sand.</p>

<p class='c006'>Experiments made on especially
prepared beds at Lawrence, Mass.
show that by treating 85000 gallons
per acre per day, 94 percent of
the organic matter and 98 percent
of the bacteria are removed, and
by treating 60,000 gallons per acre
per day, 97 to 99 percent of the
organic matter may be removed.
The above data shows that 100,000
may be successfully treated with
a five foot bed of sand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The writers inspected the intermittent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>downward filtration plant
at Mendota Illinois and the
following data were obtained.
The city has a population of
about 6000 with 8 miles of sewers
and 210 house connections.  The
average daily flow is about 350,000
gallons although during the rainy
season there is a considerable
amount of ground water present.</p>

<p class='c006'>The disposal plant was constructed
under the supervision
of the Iowa Engineering Company
of Clinton, Iowa, on a 15 acre
tract of land, one and a half miles
south of the city. Although original
plans called for 18 beds with five
feet of gravel, only four beds each
275 feet by 75 feet were finished, and
instead of 5 feet of ground only 24
inches was used.  The plant was
complete in July 1899 and was
operated until December, when it
was discontinued on account of cold
weather, it not being considered
necessary to operate it during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>winter.  From December until April
the sewage was discharged directly
into a creek which runs along one
side of the land.</p>

<p class='c006'>The beds have no automatic device
for distributing the sewage at definite
intervals of time, but are connected
with the main sewer by a number
of gate valves which were regulated
by the attendant. The sewage is
distributed by means of a wooden
sluice way which extended the entire
length of the bed and has six
inch openings on the side every
16 feet which gave a fairly even
distribution.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although no analysis of the sand
and gravel was made, it was apparent
that the uniformity coefficient was
very large.</p>

<p class='c006'>The material was shipped a
distance of 90 miles and resembles
ordinary ballast used for rail roads.
The largest pieces were thrown along
the sluice way to prevent excessive
washing.  The finest of the sand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>was of a size which would be
considered too fine for good mortar
sand. No attempt was made to
screen the material. The gravel would
not be considered first class for filtering
beds.</p>

<p class='c006'>Samples of the sewage and effluent
were taken at two different
times. The first was between 9:00
and 10:30 A. M., April 20, 1900. Until
the day before no sewage had been
applied to the beds since last fall.
The second collection was made two
weeks later, when samples of the
sewage and effluent were collected
at intervals of one hour during the
day, and mixed into composite samples.
The sewage was taken from a manhole
just above the beds, and the
effluent from the outlet of the underdrain
about 900 feet below the beds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The analysis is given in Table I.
and the results show that the beds
are not working as efficiently as
might be expected from a first class
plant. This may be accounted for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>from the fact that the filtration is
too rapid and that the material
which is less than two feet in
depth is not suitable for such
a purpose.</p>

  <h2 id='Chemical' class='c008'><span class='under'>Chemical Precipitation</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When certain chemicals are added
to sewage a precipitate is formed
which under favorable conditions
may carry down with it all the
suspended matter as well as a
portion of the dissolved organic
matter. The addition of the chemicals
together with the working of the
various appliances for grinding
and mixing the same, the decanting
of the effluent, and the caring
for the sludge all constitute what
is known as the chemical treatment
of sewage, the complete process
being in reality partly chemical
and partly mechanical.</p>

<p class='c006'>The following matter concerning
the theory of precipitation is taken
from Baker and Rafter’s Sewage
Disposal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reagents chiefly used at the
present time are lime, sulphate of
alumina, and ferrous sulphate.
In the case of lime, there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>combination of some of the lime and
with free and partially combined
carbon dioxide to form an insoluble
carbonate of lime. There is probably
a further combination of an additional
part of the lime with a portion of
the organic matter in solution. The
insoluble substances so formed sink
to the bottom, carrying with them
the major portion of the suspended
matter in the sewage in the
form of sludge.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sulphate of alumina exercises
a precipitating effort by a combination
of the sulphuric acid with lime
while alumina hydrate forms a
flocculent precipitate which entangles
and carries down the suspended
organic matters.</p>

<p class='c006'>On November 11, 1899 the writers
visited the chemical precipitation plant
at Madison Wisconsin and through
the kindness of Mr. McClellen Dodge,
City Engineer, were shown the plant
at that time in operation.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sewage was screened as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>came from the city and emptied
into a well. Here it was dosed
with lime and then pumped to
one of the four settling tanks. These
are 15 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter.
The sewage enters near the
bottom of the tanks. The sludge
settles to the bottom and the effluent
rises to the top, where it is carried away
to three of the filter beds. These three
beds are in continuous use. A fourth
bed is out of use while it is washed
and allowed to rest for one day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The total area of the beds is
5550 square feet. The flow through
the beds is about 8,000,000 gallons
per acre per day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The company that constructed
and operated the plant agreed that
the effluent on analysis should be found
to be equal to the waters of Lake Mendota
and the analyses of Lake Mendota water
which was adapted as a standard
of purity is reproduced in the Engineering
News Vol. 42 No. 26 p. 414. Samples
of the crude sewage tank effluent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and filter effluent were taken and
analyzed as shown in Table II.
A comparison of this table with the
standard shows that in no particulars
does the effluent from the plant
come up to the standard.</p>

<p class='c006'>The company has since abandoned
the contract and the city is
considering other methods of
disposal and purification “in order
that there may be no more fiascos
in civil engineering at the seat
of this well known school.”

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Another example of the use of
chemical precipitation is at Alliance,
Ohio. There are three tanks each with
a capacity of 144000 gallons. The
amount of sewage flowing into the
tanks during the year 1897 averaged
about 300,000 gallons per day. During
the year 1897 each day 180 pounds of
chemicals were added to the sewage
and 650 pounds of sludge was precipitated
and pressed daily.</p>

<p class='c006'>The total cost of the disposal plant
was $20755.00.  The cost of operation
and maintenance for the years 1897
and 1898 was $1290.00 and $1567.43
respectively. The average amount of
lime used during this time was
95000 pounds yearly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two men perform all the labor

<p class='c006'>From the chemical analyses given

  <h2 id='Septic' class='c008'><span class='under'>Septic Tank</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We will now discuss a very different
process of treating sewage, the septic
method. The septic tank consists
of a tank from which generally
the air and light are excluded and
through which the sewage flows
with a slow velocity, thus allowing
the matter in suspension to settle
to the bottom or rise to the top by reason
of its specific gravity, there to be
further acted upon or decomposed
by bacteria.  The currents should be
so guided that they are distributed
over a considerable depth and not
allowed to disturb the sediments at the
bottom or the material at the top.
The darkened ill ventilated and modestly
heated conditions in the tank are
all conducive to the propagation
of a micro-organism known as
bacteria. The activity of these organisms
causes a chemical decomposition
of the organic matter in the sewage
a part passing off as gas and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>part passing off in the effluent as
inorganic matter, while another
portion is deposited in the bottom
of the tank as sludge.</p>

<p class='c006'>So far only matter in suspension
has been considered but it is also true
that chemical action takes place
to some extent in the organic matter
in solution. This chemical action
is a denitrifying action similar
to that which takes place in
intermittent downward filtration.</p>

<p class='c006'>An important fact in the septic
tank effluent is that its compounds
have been broken down and it can
now be more readily purified.</p>

<p class='c006'>The septic tank process is self-regulating,
self-acting, requires no
attention except the occasional cleaning
out of the sludge.</p>

<p class='c006'>As an illustration of this process
the septic tank at Champaign Illinois
may be described.</p>

<p class='c006'>This tank although designed in
1895, has only been in operation since
1897. The dimensions of this tank are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>37 by 16 by 5 feet and it has a cubic
capacity of 22,000 gallons.  It has
taken care of a dry weather flow
of 300,000 gallons per day, about
13 times its cubic contents.  The
tank has operated with a range of
from 11 to 27 times its cubic capacity
with a high efficiency of purification
though much of this was ground
water.</p>

<p class='c006'>The reduction of the organic matter
in suspension, as shown by the
reduction of oxygen consumed, nitrogen
as albuminoid ammonia, and
total organic nitrogen in three analyses
averaged 94 percent. However
it is not considered that an average
of more than 80 to 90 percent may
generally be expected.  The reduction
of organic matter in solution is
considerable, averaging 17 percent.</p>

<p class='c006'>This sludge at the bottom is a
black muddy looking silt-like deposit
containing about 60 percent of water
and 5 percent of organic matter.
Its value as a fertilizer is small.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Although the amount of sludge
is relatively small the accumulation
requires removal occasionally, three
or four times a year.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is estimated that for every
1,000,000 gallons sewage there is about
3 cubic feet of dry matter.  By chemical
precipitation this would amount to
from 20 to 25 cubic feet per 1,000,000
gallons.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another good example of the
septic tank method is the one in
use at Exeter, England.</p>

<p class='c006'>This plant has been in operation
since 1896. It was designed for 98000
gallons capacity.  The sewage is allowed
to remain in the tank nearly
24 hours. The tank is used in conjunction
with five beds in which
further purification is used.  The beds
are filled with coke breeze and one is
always resting for a week at a time.
The tank is made nearly air tight
by an arched roof and any gasses
collecting may be burned at a vent.</p>

<p class='c006'>The rate of working this tank
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>is much slower than the process
at Champaign Illinois.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Southwold England, there is
another good illustration of this method.
This has been called an open
septic tank and is used in conjunction
with two beds, an anaerobic, and an
aerobic bed, the latter containing polarite.</p>

<p class='c006'>This plant is interesting from
the fact that the effluent from the
anaerobic bed is distributed over the
aerobic bed by means of a revolving
sprinkler which prevents the
liquid from passing unequally
through the large grain, porous
material. The action upon these beds
is continuous.</p>

  <h2 id='Contact' class='c008'><span class='under'>Contact Bed</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The contact bed as distinguished
from the bacteria bed may be said
to be made up of fine material, while
the bacteria beds are built of coarse
material. The latter are used for
taking out the rougher solids, and
the former for taking out the more
finely divided material, and the
organic matter in solution. While
this distinction is not commonly
made it seems to be growing into
usage.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the process of purification
by means of contact beds the sewage
is applied intermittently by distributing
pipes or troughs so as to slowly
fill the beds which are filled from
a depth of from three to six feet with
any kind of hard, porous, jagged
material. The change which takes
place is due to the action of certain
bacteria in the presence of air.
Although this process is not a new
one, the method by which the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>were obtained was not fully understood
until the more recent discoveries
in the science of bacteriology
were made.</p>

<p class='c006'>The beds are made water tight
to a depth of about four feet, the
bottom being channeled or tiled to drain
the effluent either to a secondary bed
or into the effluent channel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Many eminent men have advocated
special material as coal, coke, clinker
slag, sand, and gravel, and even glass
for filling material. The results do not
differ materially and Prof. L. P. Kennicutt
in an article in the Journal of the Association
of Engineering Societies, February
1900 makes the following statement, “The
material should be more or less porous
so as to have a larger water absorbing
area and have a jagged surface on which
the gelatinized micro-organisms can be
easily retained.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The quantity of sewage that
can be successfully treated by
intermittent filtration has
been shown not to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>over 100,000 gallons per acre per day,
a quantity so small as to be quite useless
for towns and cities which would be
obliged to construct beds with
sand not “in situ”. This point was quickly
perceived in England where sand
“in situ” is not of common occurrence.
These bacteria beds were not used long
before the problem arose: Can the amount
of land required by the intermittent
filtration method be so reduced that
the construction of artificial bacteria
beds will be a practical possibility?</p>

<p class='c006'>“The results of the investigation started
by this problem have given us what is
known as the contact system of treatment
and the septic tank treatment and
have apparently shown not only that
by combining these two methods the
amount of area required for 100,000
gallons can be reduced from one acre to
about one seventh of an acre but also that
the bacterial treatment is possible
with sewage containing manufacturing
refuse, and have outlined how
sewage containing storm water may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>be treated.”</p>

<p class='c006'>It has been found by experiment
that after two or three weeks there
is a marked reduction in the
initial capacity of the tank due
to breaking down of the filling
material and also to the filling
material becoming charged and
coated over with a gelatinous
slime consisting of living organisms
and organic matter in the
process of transformation.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the bed is not overworked the
capacity of the tank will remain
constant after the first two or three
weeks, showing that the durability
is unlimited.</p>

<p class='c006'>The beds are usually filled
in half an hour, and the sewage
allowed to remain on them about
two hours when the effluent is
run off and the beds allowed
to rest several hours before again
being filled.</p>

<p class='c006'>By contact beds in series, the
number depending upon the kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of sewage, almost any degree of purification
can be obtained.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Engineering Record of Jan. 27,
1900 gives a very interesting account
of the sewage disposal works at
Sutton, England. The works were
constructed in 1891–93, and comprise
an area of 28 acres, 18 acres only being
capable of irrigation. They were
originally designed for chemical precipitation
and broad irrigation, but
after giving these methods a two
years’ trial the local board found
itself unable to satisfy the requirements
of the conservators of the River Thames,
into which the effluent flowed.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. W. J. Dibdin advised the construction
of filters or fine grained bacteria
beds. Two beds having a
combined area of a quarter of an
acre and a capacity of 200,000
gallons, were built in 1895–96 for
the purification of the chemically
treated sewage. In 1896 the first
bacteria bed was constructed for the
treatment of crude sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>As previously stated, many tests
were made to determine the best kind
of material for filling the beds.</p>

<p class='c006'>The crude sewage, after being
screened to intercept floating matter,
is run directly onto the filters without
the addition of any chemicals.
After remaining in the beds for a
period of two hours the effluent is in
a fit condition to be discharged into
the brook leading to the Thames and
is uniformly superior to the effluent
obtainable by local land treatment.</p>

<p class='c006'>All experiments with bacteria beds
show that the objects for which they
were intended, to abolish sludge, has
been realized and that sewage can
be purified without chemicals at a
small cost, being but little more
than that incurred by the labor in
attending to, or supervising the filling
and discharging, the filters, and
that sewage purification can be
carried on with little or no nuisance.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 id='Discussion' class='c008'><span class='under'>Discussion</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The amount of purification
to be obtained by dilution depends
upon the size of the stream into
which the sewage is discharged
and also upon the amount of oxygen
contained in the stream. The latter
condition is controlled very largely
by the rate of flow of the stream
and its previous condition of pollution.
Mr. E. P. Stearns in his report to
the Massachusetts State Board of
Health, 1890, on Pollution and Self-Purification
of Streams, gave a table
showing the calculated amount of
free ammonia, dissolved solids
and chlorine which sewage adds
to running streams.</p>

<p class='c006'>Much interest is being taken in
the effect of the discharge of the
sewage of Chicago, and the waters
of Lake Michigan, into the Illinois
River, and the outcomes of the analyses
of samples taken along the river
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>is awaited with interest. Published
reports have not been given out, but
information from the most reliable
sources seem to show
that a considerable purification
takes place in the passage down
the river.</p>

<p class='c006'>No reliable data could be obtained
giving the percent of purification by
irrigation. At Berlin the sewage
is purified by this method, and
the effluent comes well within
the requirements of the German
law.</p>

<p class='c006'>With chemical treatment about
90 percent of the matter in suspension
and a small percent of that in solution
is removed, and the purification
is about 53 percent of the total
organic matter.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best examples of intermittent
downward filtration show an efficiency
of 95 percent on the total organic
matter. However, if this process
is used in connection with other
methods the organic matter may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>be reduced 99 percent and the
chemical analyses of the effluent
may fill the drinking water
requirements.</p>

<p class='c006'>Results of analyses of sewage and effluent
from septic tanks show an efficiency
of from 85 to 90 percent
in the organic matter in suspension.
Very little change takes place in
the matter in solution.</p>

<p class='c006'>The result of experiments with
a single contact bed at Sutton,
England, from November 1896 to
March 1898 shows a purification
of 64 percent; if, however, two beds
are used in series, a further
purification of 50 percent is obtained
or a total purification of 82 percent
of the crude sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'>The capacities of irrigation,
and intermittent downward filtration
plants, and contact beds are usually
stated in terms of the number of
gallons per acre per day.</p>

<p class='c006'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Secondary filtration.</p>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Table III shows the capacity
of representative plants. Best authorities
consider 100,000 gallons per acre per day
to be the maximum rate permissible
under the best conditions for the
treatment of crude sewage by the
intermittent downward filtration
system. With unfavorable conditions
the quantity of sewage should be
limited to as low as 20,000 gallons.
Wherever too large a dose is applied
to the bed the sewage is not properly
purified and the beds soon become
clogged up and unfit for further
use.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the beds are used for secondary
purification, 750,000 gallons
may be treated per acre per day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The results of extensive experiments
made at Manchester, England in 1898
and 1899 show that by means of
contact beds crude sewage may
be treated at the rate of 500,000 gallons
per acre per day. When the beds are
used for secondary purification,
750,000 gallons may be successfully
treated, and storm water sewage
treated at the rate of 2,500,000 gallons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>per acre per day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The capacity of the chemical precipitation
plant at Madison, Wisconsin
is 68 percent of the daily flow, which
in 1899 was estimated at 300,000.</p>

<p class='c006'>The company that built the
plant agreed that the plant should
have a daily capacity of 1,200,000
for each and every day in the year.
This shows the estimated capacity
of the tank to be 28 percent.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Worcester, one of the best
examples of this process is in
operation. The size of the tanks
is equal to 28 percent of the total
flow of 17.1 million gallons per day
of which 10.1 million gallons is the
out flow from a comparatively clear
pond. If the actual amount of
sewage is considered the tanks
have a capacity of 65 percent of the
total flow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rafter and Baker in their
discussion of the size of tanks
recommends that the total capacity
should be nearly 50 percent of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>average daily flow.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two typical types of septic
tanks are those at Exeter, England
and at Champaign Illinois. The
first has a cubic capacity of 93
percent of the total daily flow, while
the second has a capacity of 7.5
percent of the daily flow.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the capacity of the tank is
as small as at Champaign the
bacteria do not have time to act upon
the sewage as they would if the
flow was not so rapid.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is conceded now by the highest
authorities on this subject that the
tank should have a capacity equal
to from one fourth to one half of the
average daily flow.</p>

<p class='c006'>Concerning the conditions for which the
various processes  are applicable, it
may be said that the dilution
process is used when advantage
may be taken of natural resources.
This method can be utilized by most
cities situated along rivers or streams
large enough to sufficiently dilute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and carry away the sewage, and
fulfill sanitary requirements.</p>

<p class='c006'>As an example of the use of
dilution the Chicago River may be
cited. There the uncertain flow
of the river was made to pass inward
toward the Illinois River with
a speed of 2½ miles per hour and
a discharge of 20,000 gallons per
minute per 100,000 inhabitants. The
Blackstone River was used by the
cities of Massachusetts until the pollution
of the river became unbearable
and the state was compelled to
pass a law forcing the cities to purify
their sewage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Broad irrigation is a method
which cannot generally be used
on account of the large amount of land
and labor required. This method is
especially applicable to asylums,
alms houses, and reformatories
where cost of labor is small. It
is used in the West where the
value of all available water leads
to the application of sewage to crops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and also on account of the low stage
of western streams during the
summer which renders sewage
discharged into them an unbearable
nuisance.</p>

<p class='c006'>Intermittent downward filtration
may be used where there is a
considerable area of sandy soil,
and also where a high degree of
purification is necessary.</p>

<p class='c006'>Chemical precipitation does
not require a large area for its
operation and used alone does
not give a high degree of purification.
Where land and material for beds
is expensive, and partial purification
is sufficient, this system may be
used.</p>

<p class='c006'>The septic tank requires a small
area. The odors are not offensive
and cannot be noticed 100 feet away.
The effluent may be discharged
into small streams and soon loses
its identity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Contact beds are used where a high
degree of purity is required; if the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>effluent is emptied into rivers or
sources of water supply. The beds
do not require a large area and
the process may be recommended
if suitable material is at hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cost of construction and
maintenance of the different systems
vary so largely according to local
conditions that a fair estimate is
not possible. As the most striking
example of maximum and minimum
cost the disposal system at Chicago
and at Lowell, Massachusetts may
be cited. The purification in both
cases is by dilution, the cost being
practically nothing at Lowell while
the Chicago Drainage Canal cost
$33,000,000. It may not be fair to
charge this entire cost to the sewerage
system; nevertheless up to date it
has been used for no other purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>At Berlin, Germany where broad
irrigation is used, the sewage has to
be pumped to the farms and involves
a considerable cost. Aside
from this the receipts derived from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>sale of farm products are enough
to pay the running expenses of the
farm.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first cost of the intermittent
downward filtration plant is estimated
by the writers at $90,000 per million
gallons per day of sewage treated,
where the beds are artificial.  Where
natural beds can be used the first
cost may be reduced to $7,500 per
million gallons per day.  The cost
of maintenance is about $2.00 per
1,000,000 gallons.</p>

<p class='c006'>The average cost for operating
a chemical disposal plant is about
58 cents per inhabitant per year, or
$16.00 per 1,000,000 gallons treated.
At Manchester England where broad
irrigation and chemical precipitation
are used in combination, the average
cost was $63.00 per 1,000,000 gallons
treated.</p>

<p class='c006'>A septic tank for treating 1,000,000
gallons of sewage per day will cost
less than $10,000 and the cost of
maintenance will be about $1.00 per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>1,000,000 gallons treated.</p>

and requirements of the city should
be carefully studied and analyzed,
and judgment and discretion must
be used.  A matter of so much
importance to the community should
be placed in the hands of men
qualified to make a proper solution
of the problem. While in general
several methods of purification
may be applied to the requirements
of the city, usually local conditions
and considerations will narrow
the choice to two plans or possibly
to a single method.</p>

<p class='c006'>The governing features of the
dilution process are so distinct that
it is not usually difficult to determine
where this method is applicable, and
likewise, the broad irrigation process has
peculiar conditions. In both, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>plans involve only matters of
construction.</p>

<p class='c006'>The other methods have more
in common and the determination
of their relative value is not so
easy. As before stated, the recently
developed biolytic processes promise
to displace chemical precipitation.
Where a suitable deposit of sand or
gravel is conveniently located on
cheap land which may be made
without great expense into filtration
areas and the sewage discharged
upon them by gravity, intermittent
downward filtration may be the most
satisfactory, especially if a highly
purified effluent is desired. The
item of expense of attendance, and
labor of maintenance must be considered
in connection with the cost
of this method. In the absence of such
favorable conditions and especially
where complete purification is not
required the septic tank may be
the most suitable. For higher purification
the combination of the septic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>tank with filter beds, or contact
beds run at comparatively high
rates, makes a satisfactory purification
and is applicable to a
wide range of conditions. A bacteria
bed may be substituted for the septic
tank for the roughing process
but its applicability in not so general.</p>

<p class='c006'>In conclusion it may be said
that if the next ten years gives
as much development in sewage
purification as has the last
decade, some of the processes
herein outlined will have been
discarded and sanitary engineering
will have achieved still greater
triumphs.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
